- **Feature:** The application now fetches and displays client information when a client is selected.
- **Refactor:** Updated the output directory structure and filename format for generated invoices to a more standardized convention.
- **Chore:** The `public/ultima_factura_generada` directory is now wiped clean before a new invoice is generated.
- **Feature:** Implemented a dynamic "Generate Invoice" button that changes its state based on the form data.
- **Feature:** Added an "Emergency Generate" button to generate invoices without saving them to the database.
- **Refactor:** Updated the backend to handle the creation of new clients and vehicles when generating an invoice.
- **Fix:** Resolved a critical bug related to date parsing that could cause off-by-one-day errors due to timezone differences. Standardized on `YYYY-MM-DD` for all date handling between the frontend and backend, and ensured all date manipulations on the backend are done in UTC.
- **Refactor:** Modified the invoice creation process to ensure the PDF file path is correctly stored in the database.
- **Fix:** Corrected a logical flaw where the file path was being generated before the invoice ID was available.
- **Refactor:** Streamlined the `createFactura` controller and removed the redundant `generateFactura` function.
- **Refactor:** Updated the `storePDF` function to remove unused parameters.
- **Security:** Moved the calculation of invoice totals from the frontend to the backend to prevent manipulation and ensure data consistency.
- **Feature:** Added backend validation for the invoice creation endpoint using JSON schemas.
